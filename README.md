# Bike-Rental-Analysis
Choosing bike sharing system as a medium of transport will allow an eco-friendlier way of transportation. A bike rental is a bicycle business that rents bikes for short periods of time. Bike rental shops rent by the day or week as well as by the hour, and these provide an excellent opportunity for people like travelers and tourists, who don't have access to a vehicle. Specialized bike rental shops thus typically operate at beaches, parks, or other locations that tourists frequently visit. In this case, the fees are set to encourage renting the bikes for a few hours at a time, rarely more than a day. The objective of this Case is to predict the bike rental count based on the environmental and seasonal settings, so that required bikes would be arranged and managed by the shops according to environmental and seasonal conditions.
